## Contributing:
1. Alphabetically add your addition here to [README.md](README.md) in the format `[<language name>](<file-name>), <number-of-lines> lines`. Count the number of lines _after_ the file is formatted by your editor to prevent unreadable code. 
2. Add a file to the root of the repo in the form of: `<language-name>.<file-extension>` that satisfies the rules above. 

## Notes:
Try to write a detailed commit message.

If possible make sure you end your file with a newline at the end and are using LF as opposed to CRLF Line sequences.

Feel free to improve on existing solutions if you can do better :)
